This program simulates Conways Game of Life.

The Game of Life universe is set in a 2 dimensional grid.  The cells in the life field can be in one of two states: dead or alive.  
Each generation, the cells interact with its 8 neighbours giving rise to these 4 rules:
   
    A living cell with less than 2 live neighbours die (of starvation)
    A living cell with 2-3 live neighbours live
    A living cell with more than 3 neighbours die (of the plague)
    A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbours become alive (by divine intervention)

When running the program, copy and paste the contents of the input file (for example Sample.in). 
The program will then simulate the life cycle of the cells.

Input file:
The first line is in the format <width> <height> <number of generations>
The remainding lines represent the grid, with an o representing an alive cell and a . representing a dead cell
